# fnc-extras
Extra materials for _Fundamentals of Numerical Computation_ by Driscoll and Braun.

The easiest way to obtain the functions and code examples that appear in the book is to download the [toolbox file](Fundamentals%20of%20Numerical%20Computation.mltbx) and double-click it to install as a toolbox in MATLAB. 

- **data** Data files needed for certain exercises.
- **fnc** Files for all the textbook functions and code examples.
- **labs** Laboratory-style exercises to accompany the text.
- **projects** Projects relating to one or more chapters in the text. 
- **slides** PPT and PDF slides for the first half of the text.

## Videos

### Added August 2019

There is a new playlist of videos based on the textbook at

The plan is to populate it with videos throughout the fall, for chapters 1-6. 

### From 2012

There are videos based on an older (pre-publication) version of the text at the youtube channel

The ordering has changed since the videos were made, but many still correspond to sections of the text.
