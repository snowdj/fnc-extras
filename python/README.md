# Python codes

These Python codes are replacements for the MATLAB codes in _Fundamentals of Numerical Computation_ by Driscoll and Braun.

## Overview

The codes are broken into two groups: functions, designated as such by the text and provided in source code files, and chapter-by-chapter examples, which correspond to Examples in the text and are provided as Jupyter notebooks. 

## Viewing examples

You can [view the examples as notebooks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tobydriscoll/fnc-extras/tree/master/python/) using nbviewer. 

## Running examples locally 

The examples have been tested on the Anaconda distribution of Python 3.7.3 on MacOS, with version 2.2.2 of matplotlib, v1.2.1 of scipy, and v1.14.3 of numpy. 

The functions (as opposed to the examples) can be accessed via `import FNC`.
